              Chernobyl will remain a prominent historical event that contributed significantly to the end of the USSR.
              You will visit on the 25th April 1986, that fateful day. You will also get to meet and interact with people before, during and after the event. Beware, you will be powerfully moved by the heroism and inventable fate of the people involved.
              You will also get to see the remains as they are today.</p>
