        <h2>Time Travel</h2>
        <p>Time Travel Tours has developed cutting edge technology that allows us to travel in time and visit the past. We specialise in the soviet union, as that is where our base of operations is. We have contacts in the past and present that help us to set up inconspicuous tours in never-before-seen locations.</p>

        <h2>Safety</h2>
        <p>Because of the risky nature of time travel, we must ask that our clients follow our expert tour guide's instructions at all times. If you follow instructions, you will be safe, but if you venture out on your own, you may find out the unfortunate consequences of the butterfly effect for yourself.</p>
